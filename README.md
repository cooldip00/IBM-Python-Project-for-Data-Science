# Stock Market Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project showcases my skills as a Data Scientist / Data Analyst by simulating a real-world scenario where I work for a startup investment firm. The objective is to help customers make informed investment decisions by analyzing financial data, such as historical share prices and quarterly revenue reports, for popular stocks like Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.

The project involves:

- Extracting financial data using Python libraries and web scraping.
- Analyzing this data to identify patterns or trends.
- Visualizing the data using interactive dashboards to present insights clearly.

## What You'll Learn

This project is designed to demonstrate foundational Python skills for data science and analytics, including:

- **Python Fundamentals**: Using Python data structures, libraries, and functions to manipulate and analyze data.
- **Web Scraping**: Extracting data from various online sources using tools like Beautiful Soup.
- **Data Analysis**: Applying Pandas for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating interactive dashboards using Plotly for effective data visualization and communication.

By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience in data science tasks that are highly relevant in real-world scenarios.

## Project Structure

- **Data Extraction**: Collect financial data (historical share prices, quarterly revenue reports, etc.) using Python libraries and web scraping techniques.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Use Pandas to analyze data and identify trends and patterns.
- **Data Visualization**: Build an interactive dashboard with Plotly to visualize the results and present them in a user-friendly format.
- **Documentation**: A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook explaining each step of the project and a README file (this file) detailing the project.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data extraction, analysis, and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment to write and execute code.
- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Beautiful Soup**: A library for web scraping to extract data from web pages.
- **Plotly**: A graphing library for creating interactive visualizations.
